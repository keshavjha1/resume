    "bio": "As a Full stack Developer, I work on every phase of software development. User experience has become the center of major B2C/B2B applications, I work in a cross functional team to accomplish it. In the case of B2B application availability, resilience and securities have become flashpoints, I work on new technology to provide best possible ways to serve B2B software development. Sailing through teams and time, I learn every important aspect of software business, starting from defining its need and corresponding validation. I implement POCs to check feasibility of business problems, estimating effort. I enjoy working in teams with different kinds of projects and technology.",
